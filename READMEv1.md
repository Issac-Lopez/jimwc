README

    1)This project was developed to help beginners start their computer science skill set. This app will primarily focus on people who are interested in changing careers but need to increase their knowledge in the respective field. This project can be accessed  through an internet browser and mobile browser. Our goal was to make this application easy to use and accessible from anywhere with internet or mobile data.

Description
   
    1)This app will have different levels of knowledge that pertains to HTML. This program contains questions that will help you familiarize  HTML. This file will give you different questions that the user will be required to answer. The goal is to answer all the questions so that the user can move onto the next difficulty level.  Once the user has answered all ten questions correctly they are able to move onto the next section.
Usage

    1)This program would be used to test your knowledge on basic HTML. This app can be used to check the syntax and the validity of Html Statements. In order to use this application you will need access
Structure

    1)Scripts
        Const questionMain contains modules that are held in an array, this will pass in the Id of an element. This section of code generates the text boxes that the user types into.  This section also holds the code for the size and shape of the text box for the user input. This will also call to the questions.js to populate the questions that the user has to answer. You will also find the function for our “button”. This will look at the user's input and see if they got the correct answer. This can be found in the “let btn” function. The function isMatch will take the user's response and compare it to the key. If the user has the correct answer they will see a level complete prompt. isIncorrect you will find a code snippet that looks at the user's response to see if it's incorrect. If the user response is incorrect they will see the prompt “incorrect-msg”
    2)Styles
        This file holds the general structure of the web-app. This allowed us to add colors and resize the elements.
    3)Questions
        This is where the quiz questions will be found. You could extrapolate this data and increase or decrease the amount of questions needed to pass onto the next level. This also has the function that has the questions . It has the prompts for the main question and the main box for the answer. You can find the team information in this section as well. In this section we have a portion for bootstrap to be implemented. This bootstrap function would use javascript and CCS then convert it ito HTML by manipulating the extra contents on the web application.
    4)Index
        Here you will find different methods that are used to compile the web based application. The main concept for this section can be found in the class=”link-menu”. This links the three languages (“contact.html”,”learn=css.html”, and learn-js.html) In this section you will aslo find a playground for the user where they can review what they already learned.
Dependencies
    
    1)The two external dependencies would be Java Script and HTML
